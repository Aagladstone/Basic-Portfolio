     Hi there. My name is Aaron Gladstone, I was born and raised in Houston, Texas, and am currently in the Houston Coding Academy. 
    I graduated from Baylor University in 2015 with a degree in Film, and Digital Media. I can't wait to learn how to code so I can 
    start a new career. 
         </p> 

          <p>
         I would consider myseslf an extroverted introvert, and the way I describe that is I can be very extroverted, but it wares out
    the introvert inside me. That being said it might take me awhile to get out of my shell, yet even when I do, it uses everything I have.
    My favorite interests are sports and video games. That being said I am terrible at both, but I love to spectate and discuss the 
    happenings. 
          </p>
          <p>
              I'm very excited to get started and learn this new world of coding. I consider myself a quick learner, but this might take me 
              a bit to get ahold of. 
          </p>
